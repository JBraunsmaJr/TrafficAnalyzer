# IMPORTANT
The master branch is **protected** meaning you **cannot** push to it. The idea is the master branch must always be the *working* prototype, or *release*. 

1. You will have to pull the lastest version of master
2. Create a new branch based off master
3. Work on your feature
4. Push to repo when you're ready
5. Create Pull Request (from your branch to master). Be sure that it's set to **squash** commits. 
6. Go through the code review process and once it's done it'll get merged into master
7. Repeat process

# What should I work on?
If you aren't sure what to do, checkout the [issues](https://github.com/JBraunsmaJr/TrafficAnalyzer/issues) page. If one of them tickles your interest and isn't being worked on feel free to take ownership of that ticket!

Also, if something you want to work on is NOT there -- create a ticket/issue for it. This way your work is being tracked and to help reduce overlap. In your pull requests make sure to link the issue pertaining to the work!
